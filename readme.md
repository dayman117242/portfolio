## What's This?

This page is a gallery of the various creative projects I have produced during my time in the Digital Media master's program at University of Central Florida. Drawing inspiration from my love for retro culture, my work comments on and subverts nostalgia, seeking ways to consolidate past aesthetics and technologies with newer ones today.

A minimalist pixelated adventure game/interactive fiction. The monochromatic green palette evokes the military and jungle setting characteristic of its eighties action movie inspirations while also emulating the contemporaneous Game Boyâ€™s graphics, viscerally capturing the retro verisimilitude of a much explored era. Largely referencing the iconic Arnold Schwarzenegger flick Predator, the game allows players to find mission logs in the form of interactive objects, encouraging exploration throughout the environment as a tribute to the classic adventure genre.

I developed this as my final creative project just in time for December. Originally intended as an alien space shooter, the game began to take on a more festive theme of protecting castaway gifts scattered around Planet CupCage by shooting down the titular X-MasTerrestrials, evil aliens seeking to steal Christmas. The game uses basic mouse-click mechanics to simulate shooting and hitting UFOs, simply point and click on the invaders and the occasional mothership to win points and save Christmas. The game is a survival shooter, meaning you will have to brave waves of thieving aliens for a certain duration of time before progressing to the next level. Each level will get increasingly challenging as the aliens get faster and more motherships come in to swipe a wider array of presents. Lose too many presents and the game is over, Christmas is canceled, so be on your toes with this one and keep your trigger finger ready. If you want to play again just reload the page. Have fun!

# [Word & Sorcery]()

I integrated ChatGPT into a text generation program with a green font and black background to emulate classic text adventure games. You can make subsequent text responses appear consecutively below previous ones to experience a fun (and somewhat chaotic) sensation of game progression.

In the distant future, Father and his sentient creation I have an intellectual discussion concerning existentialism, omnipotence, and the fate of humanity.

Mixing various AI techniques (Dream Studio, Kaiber, and Arbitrary Style Transfer) with rotoscoping software EbSynth, the visually generated work intends to comment on itself regarding the rapidly advancing technologies of AI and their ramifications in human civilization.
